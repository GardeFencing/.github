## 🚀 About Garde
Garde is an automated fencing coach being created with Davis Fencing Academy, a Team USA Fencing certified association. Garde aims to perform a robust analysis of a fencer's form and harness generative A.I. to give detailed feedback as to how the fencer can gradually improve over time. Additionally, Garde allows coaches to access their students' videos and give individual feedback. We hope that Garde is used by leading fencing institutions not only in Davis and The Bay Area, but also worldwide. This application is truly one of a kind and is patent pending.

## 🥞 Tech Stack
Currently, Garde uses Next.JS and Tailwind CSS to create an intuitive and immersive frontend, alongside Tensorflow.JS, and Plotly for pose estimation and visualization. User authentication has been implemented in house to fit our infrastructure, and offers a seamless transition between the landing page and the fencer and coach pages. For the backend, Garde uses Cloudflare D1 and Cloudflare R2 to store valuable user data and videos. Garde uses ML to analyze and visualize fencer form, and uses generative AI to give valuable feedback that the fencer can use.
